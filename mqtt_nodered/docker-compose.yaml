# PORTS: <HOST>:<CONTAINER>
#Volume mapping allows all configuration and data to be stored on the host file system, or elsewhere on the network. Configuration of Node-RED is assumed to be in folder node-red, relative to the compose file location, and Mosquitto configuration and data is assumed to be under folder mosquitto.
#The compose file defines a private bridge network called localnet. Code running in containers can use service names specified in compose file as host names. In the Node-RED container, broker will resolve to IP address of the container running Mosquitto.
# Port mapping allows container services to be available to applications running on the host or host network. A browser running on the host can access Node-RED at http://localhost:1880. Another machine on the same network can access it at http://<ip address of host>:1880. Mosquitto can be accessed at port 1883 on the host network.
# default mapserver port is 8080 (or 80 if root) inside the container, map that to sth free outside (1886?)
